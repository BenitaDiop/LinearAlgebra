## 1.1 Systems of linear equations

A **linear equation** in the variables x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub> is an equation that can be written in the form

   a<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + ... + a<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> = b
   
where b and the **coefficients** a<sub>1</sub>,...,a<sub>1</sub> are real or complex numbers, usually known in advance.
