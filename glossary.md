## 1.1 Systems of linear equations

A **linear equation** in the variables x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub> is an equation that can be written in the form

   a<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + ... + a<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> = b
   
where b and the **coefficients** a<sub>1</sub>,...,a<sub>1</sub> are real or complex numbers, usually known in advance.

A **system of linear equations** (or a **linear system**) is a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables, e.g., x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>.

A **solution** of the system is a list (s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>,...s<sub>n</sub>) of numbers that makes each equation a true statement when the values s<sub>1</sub>,...s<sub>n</sub> are substituted for x<sub>1</sub>,...x<sub>n</sub>, respectively.

The set of all possible solutions is called the **solution set** of a linear system.

Two lnear systems are called **equivalent** if they have the same solution set. (Each solution to the first system is a solution to the second, and vice versa.)

A system of linear equations has  

1. no solution, or
2. exactly one solution, or
3. infinitely many solutions.

A system of linear equations is said to be **consistent** if it has either one solution or infinitely many solutions; A system is **inconsistent** if it has no solution.

The essential information of a linear system can be recorded compactly in a rectangular array called a **matrix**.

Three basic **row operations** are used to simplify a linear system:  

1. Replace one equation by the sum of itself anda  multiple of another equation.
2. Interchange two equations.
3. Multiply all terms of an equation by a nonzero constant.

Two matrices are called **row equivalent** if there is a sequence of elementary row operations that transforms one matrix into the other.
